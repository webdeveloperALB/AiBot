        </h2>
        <p>
          Prices of digital assets can be highly volatile and may fluctuate
          significantly over short periods. Market conditions can be influenced
          by regulatory changes, technological developments, and broader
          economic factors.

          2. Leverage Risks
        </h2>
        <p>
          Trading on margin or leverage amplifies both potential gains and
          losses. Losses can exceed your initial deposit.

          trade with funds you can afford to lose.
